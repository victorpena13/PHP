<!--We are going to build a server name generator. To do this, we will need to follow the specs below.-->
<!--Create a new file in your public directory named server-name-generator.php.-->
<!--Create two arrays.-->
<!--One containing at least 10 adjectives.-->
<!--Another containing at least 10 nouns.-->
<!--Create a function that will return a random element from an array.-->
<!--Create a function that returns the string value of our new server name made by combining a random adjective with a random noun.-->
<!--Each time you refresh the page a different result should be displayed.-->
<!--Make sure you have fun with it. Add CSS to make it fancy.-->
